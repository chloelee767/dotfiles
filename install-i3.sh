# For Manjaro XFCE 20
sudo pacman -S i3 i3exit i3-scrot rofi nitrogen xautolock compton lxappearance pa-applet

# Notes:
#
# lxappearance:
# Enable GTK themes for system tray icons, file explorer etc.
# Changes using lxappearance on the i3 session won't persist though, have to use XFCE's theme manager while logged into XFCE
#
# pa-applet:
# Volume control. Can't get the XFCE volume applet to work for some reason.
# minor issue: 2 volume applets on XFCE.
